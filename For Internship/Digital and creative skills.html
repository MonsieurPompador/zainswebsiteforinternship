<em><h2><p>Achivements at College</p></h2></em>
<p>At college, I had achieved distinction and merits on some of my tasks, I was able to format and actively use Microsoft applications such as Word and PowerPoint. A majority of my achivements comes from theory work which involved topics such as cybersecurity, IT issues and using Adobe applications such as Photoshop.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I had been renowned for my achievements in Level 2 IT, where we had studied social media and using applications such as Photoshop to create logos and images for websites. We had used a variety of options to achieve this, in Level 2 I had also been awarded for my work that I produced gaining praise for my efforts from my course teachers.</p>
<p>Throughout my IT course I had done a lot with logging work and discovering various sectors of IT where I was honestly unsure of exactly what type of faction I should enter and what I would work best towards.</p>
<p> Currently, I am part a coding course which should dictate any further notions of being able to perform coding (using HTML, Javascript etc).</p>

<em><h3><p>Level 2 BTEC</p></h3></em>
<p>I attended Cheadle College after finishing school and enroled into a Level 2 IT course. My teachers were Carol and Matt. In Level 2, I had to explain the uses of hardware and software, identify parts of a computer (such as motherboard and RAM), I had to work on a specific unit dedicated towards graphics and learning the functionalities of other devices such as printers.</p>
<p>In Level 2, with my teacher Matt we did work which was considered less practical such as communication methods, workplace safety, job characteristics and research as well as helpdesk (working with computer requests.) Social media was also a a major part in my Level 2 course, analysing how social media was promoted was also something I had worked on.</p>
<p>I'd say the most predominant element of my level 2 course was editing using Photoshop as well as using Paint to create images as well as studying IT in relation to business marketing (such as studying target audiences) as well as further information on how to create an eye-catching website.</p>

<em><h3><p>Level 3 BTEC</p></h3></em>
<p>Unfortunately, due to COVID my college was closed off for a good few months, I spent most of my time at home and we didn't get to complete Unit 21 of my IT course, I was unaware of the specifications for that unit. Regardless of not completing Level 2 entirely, I was allowed to move upwards to the Level 3 BTEC - it was at first speculated that perhaps I couldn't perform well in Level 3 but that was later proven wrong when I had achieved distinctions in my course (2020 achievement report).</p>
<p>My Level 3 IT course included using flowcharts to describe the navagation of websites, game design, working with data (such as logging data), social media promotion (adveritising) and a lot to do with HTML. I also had to learn about various business methodologies (such as PRINCE2, Waterfall.) </p>
<p>Recently, I had published a website using GitHub as a third party on HTML, you can see it here: https://monsieurpompador.github.io/bringingtheoutside/</p>
