<em><h2>Types of Jobs I'd be interested in</h2></em>
<p>Below are a list of jobs that I think I'd be interested in:</p>
<ul> - Programmer (such as coding) </ul>
<ul> - IT Technician</ul>
<ul> - Business Marketing </ul>
<ul> - Web Developer</ul>
<ul> - Project Manager</ul>

<em><h3>Reasons for my choices</h3></em>
<p> I have chosen programming because I do have an interest in programming websites, by discovering and using HTML code I have gradually learnt the basics on how to forge HTML code to at least a basic extent, while I am further advancing in how HTML and CSS styling may function within my current coding course I am able to make a functioning website. This is also where my interest in being a potential website developer had come into place, as I feel I can develop websites once I learn how to become an advanced coder.</p>
<p>I have been interested in being an IT technician for some time, although I remain unsure about whether I intend to pursue it as other jobs in the IT industry have also sparked my interests, I am also unaware of as to whether or not my experiences will be as helpful in comparison to others on the helpdesk.</p>
<p>Finally,  my interest in business marketing and project management have also come into place as I have developed plenty of knowledge on how social media works, what attracts audiences and observing a well-maintained attitude towards organising, planning and time management in order to ensure a task is complete. </p>
